### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Raphael 

I was born in a small Pantanal town and learned to love Mother Nature. I also graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Engineering! 
The mind loves nature and technology, soo crazy! 

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on the Big Idea of growing and producing my own food.
- ðŸŒ± I like to keep up to date on: 
    - Software Engineering 
    - System on a Chip
    - Artificial Intelligence (AI)
    - RPA - Robotic Process Automation 
    - Business Intelligence
    - Zero Waste
    - Organic Food
    - Circular Economy

It's hard to choose just one code language, I prefer to look at the problem I want to solve and create the architecture for it (but I'm in love with python S2).
